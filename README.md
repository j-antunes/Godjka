### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is JoÃ£o Antunes and I'm a Mechanical Engineer. My background is in Control theory and I started my career as a vehicle dynamicist. My day to day is spent building from simple (point mass) to complex 14+ DOF models, that help simulate vehicle's in a variety of scenarios.

To help me build these types of simulations I rely on Python, C#, VB.NET, MATLAB, QT, Django, React, Flask, Docker, AWS (S3, ELB, Athena, EC2, Batch) and HTML.

I'm very interested in vehicle dynamics and autonomous cars. Feel free to reach out!
